<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi, my name is Natalie Rauf! I am currently a student at Ohio State University. I am pursuing degrees in CIS with a related field in art and design and Neuroscience. Originally, I was on a 
  pre-healthcare path, but right before my 4th year, I decided that healthcare was not the right path for me. I ended up exploring my more creative and technical side and 
  added a second degree in computer science. I have since decided that I want to work in front-end development and have chosen my classes to reflect that. The CIS major allows me to pick a related field, 
  which I chose as art and design. My goal in choosing this was to be able to work effectively with a design team and to be able to code for both functionality and design.</p>

<p>I took this Udemy course because I wanted to stay on top of my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, while also learning new web development skills. I especially wanted to learn React and Node.js. I also plan 
  to build some of my own websites this summer and will be able to add them to my portfolio. This, of course, is just a simple HTML version, but I will soon have a fully 
  functioning webpage with all my projects.</p>
